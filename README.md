# Proposal
1. An animal(a dinosaur or a dog) runs from the left of the screen.
2. The user controls this animal to jump by hitting a key to jump over obstacles. 
3. There is one coin randomly displayed on the top of some obstacles. 
4. A score is maintained and displayed on the top of the screen.
5. When the user jump over one obstacle and gain one coin, this coin disappears and the score increased by 1.
6. A running distance is maintained and displayed on the top right of the screen.
7. When this animal runs without hitting the obstacle, running distance keeps increasing.
8. When this animal hits the obstacle, this game ends and the running distance is displayed with a text—“game over” on the center of the screen.
